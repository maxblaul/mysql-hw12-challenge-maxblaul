## Description 

This is a MYSQL Database application that allows a user to store employee data.

## Installation

You may install the files by cloning the repo into your gitbash or terminal. In order to do any of this you also need VS Code. package.json and package-lock.json are already installed in this file so you shouldn't have to do it yourself. But if for whatever reason they don't install correctly just type 'npm i' in your terminal. As well as 'npm install inquirer'. Also needed, is MYSQL. You may install it by writing 'npm install --save mysql' in your terminal.

## Usage 

This app is designed to organize and sort employee information. It has some seed data and can also take user data. To run the app go to the terminal and type 'node server.js'. Follow the prompts. There will then show the proper data tables as per selection. User may also add new data to the table in the form of departments, roles, and employees.

## Tests

Additional tests and changes must be made to ensure that a manager can be designated for an employee. I could not get that to work. I figured it was best to turn in the project 'mostly done' as opposed to pulling my hair out over it.
